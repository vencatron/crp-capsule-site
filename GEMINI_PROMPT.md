## The Story to Animate (Frame Sequence)

### Act 1: The Problem (Frames 1-25)
**Frames 1-10:** Opening - fade in title "Stop Paying Taxes. Start Building Assets."
**Frames 11-20:** Animate a pie chart showing ~40% of income going to taxes (federal 30%+ state 9%+)
**Frames 21-25:** Text appears: "What if that capital could build wealth instead?"

### Act 2: The Solution Concept (Frames 26-50)
**Frames 26-35:** Dollar sign transforms/flows into a building icon
**Frames 36-45:** Text: "Turn Tax Dollars into Generational Wealth"
**Frames 46-50:** Tagline appears: "We Don't Flip Houses. We Build Oil Wells."

### Act 3: How It Works - Cost Segregation & Bonus Depreciation (Frames 51-80)
**Frames 51-60:** Show a property purchase price ($1.2M example) breaking down
**Frames 61-70:** Animate the cost segregation process:
  - $1.2M Purchase → $300K Land (crossed out, non-depreciable)
  - $900K Building Value → magnifying glass identifies short-life assets
**Frames 71-80:** Arrow pointing to "$300,000 Year 1 Tax Deduction" with "100% Bonus Depreciation" label

### Act 4: The Partnership Structure (Frames 81-105)
**Frames 81-90:** Show 3 partner icons pooling funds into central LLC
**Frames 91-100:** LLC icon connects to property asset, show governance labels (pro-rata voting, ownership)
**Frames 101-105:** Risk shield layers animate in: LLC Protection → Hazard Insurance → D&O → Home Warranty

### Act 5: The Financial Cycle (Frames 106-130)
**Frames 106-115:** Year 1 flow: Investment → 100% Bonus Depreciation → Tax Savings
**Frames 116-125:** Subsequent years: Rental Income → Operating Costs → Net Profit
**Frames 126-130:** Profit splits two ways: Pro-Rata Distribution (cash) OR Reinvest (piggy bank/next deal)

### Act 6: Call to Action (Frames 131-150)
**Frames 131-140:** Summary icons appear: Tax Efficiency, Wealth Creation, Risk Mitigation, Transparency
**Frames 141-145:** "The Path to Partnership" - 3 steps: Introductory Call → Strategy Session → Deal Review
**Frames 146-150:** Final frame with contact CTA, fade to end state

## Key Visual Elements to Include
- Buildings/properties (commercial real estate style)
- Dollar signs and money flow arrows
- Tax documents with percentage symbols
- Shield icons for protection/insurance layers
- Partner/people icons (professional, suited figures)
- Charts showing growth trajectories
- LLC entity boxes with connecting lines
- Magnifying glass (for cost segregation analysis)
- Calendar/clock icons (Year 1 emphasis)

## Animation Principles
- Each frame should show subtle progression from the previous
- Use smooth transitions (fade, slide, scale)
- Key information should appear gradually, not all at once
- Movement should guide the eye through the story
- Maintain visual consistency across all frames

## Reference Materials
- `real-estate-investing.png` - Visual style reference
- `Stop_Paying_Start_Building.pdf` - Full presentation content
- `OBBBA_100_Bonus_Depreciation_Real_Estate_Brief.md` - Technical tax details
- `reference-frames/` - Example WebP frames showing format/size targets

## Output
Generate all frames into a `frames/` directory. After generating, provide a summary of what each frame range depicts.
